When I came to Grand Valley State University in late 2010, they were already trying to find a solution to the increased mobile usage of their website. That year, the GVSU Library website traffic from mobile devices was a measley .5% of all visits, while the University as a whole saw traffic from mobile devices reach 4.5% of all visits. Now just 18 months later, GVSU's library has a tenfold increase in mobile traffic. Visits from mobile devices for the first 6 months of this year hit 4.95%. That's 1 in every 20 visitors to our website using a mobile device. This growth is only continuing.

Most of the discussion about providing access to our services for mobile users centered around the most common practice at the time: detecting a user's device or browser and serving up a different, "stripped-down" version of the lbrary website to mobile devices. Libraries thus find themselves supporting two websites: the "mobile" website and the "desktop" website. (Some even support a separate "iPhone" website.) The effect is to create the perception of two different "Webs", the "Mobile Web," where efficiency rules, and the "Desktop Web," which is what everyone thinks of as the Web.

But this is just a perception. "There is no Mobile Web," Stephen Hay wrote. "There is only The Web, which we view in different ways."[http://www.the-haystack.com/2011/01/07/there-is-no-mobile-web/] By cordoning off mobile devices into a ghettoized "Mobile Web," we convinced ourselves that people using the Web on mobile devices were doing something very different than those using the "Desktop" web. We made a lot of assumptions about web browsers and our users, in other words.

Web design has always been a little stuck in awe of the traditions of print. For many years, we web designers relied on tables to create layouts and controlled and sophisticated as print brochures. We clamored for control, and fought to have our sites look the same in every browser. But what we missed in all of this was that the fluidity and lack of control the Web offers the designer is not a bug; rather, it is a feature. As John Allsopp wrote twelve years ago," The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesnâ€™t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility." [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dao/]

We made assumptions about mobile devices, as well. In the early ninties, a teenager like Zach Morris on Saved By the Bell using a cell phone was a punch line in a sitcom. Mobile phones were for busy professionals who were on the go and didn't have time to wait around for calls. They certainly weren't going to be someone's primary communications tool. Twenty years later, we are on track to have more activated mobile devices than people on the planet[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/0,,contentMDK:23190786~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282823,00.html]. 88% of Americans own a cell phone, and nearly half of those are smartphones.[http://pewinternet.org/Infographics/2012/A-Closer-Look-at-Gadget-Ownership.aspx] A whopping 77% of teens age 12-17 have a cellphone, and 25% of those are smartphones.[http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Teens-and-smartphones/Summary-of-findings.aspx] Mobile phones are no longer a business tool for the distracted professional. They are a lifestyle tool for everyone.

But the myth of the Mobile web still encourages us to think about mobile web use as occasional use by distracted people who are on the go on a slow network. These assumptions about users are entrenched. But the data shows a more complicated picture of how people use the web on mobile devices. According to a 2012 Pew Internet report, 17% of cell phone owners connect to the web primarily or only through their phone, while 45% of 18-29 year-old who browse the web on their phone use the phone as their primary device. [http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012.aspx]  

How we use our phones is different in reality as well. TK% of smartphone owners browse the web on a mobile device while home, TK% while waiting in line or during miscellaneous downtimes[SOURCE], and TK% even admit to using them in the bathroom[SOURCE]. The thing is, phones are increasingly becoming a go-to web browsing device. As libraries who strive to provide access everyone, making our services available on mobile devices is a must. Clearly we need a way out of the myth of the Mobile Web.

But we might still make use of device and browser detection without falling into the trap of the "Mobile Web," couldn't we? Perhaps, but there are other technical challenges with these methods that will be difficult to overcome. First, with countless smartphone models released every week, keeping up with such a device or browser library is unsustainable, especially for the small, perpetually understaffed library web team. In addition, this requires our small teams (or more likely, individuals) to maintain two (or three) separate code bases, even if each site offers complete functionality. 

Perhaps the most frustrating problem with this method affect users. By redirecting to a mobile version of the website, we generate multiple URLs for the same content. If a user visits our site on a mobile device to read an article and is redirected to http://m.oursite.com/article, then when they share that URL with others, everyone will be directed to the mobile version of the page. This can be frustrating to users on desktop computers, who often get a site formatted for a very different screen. Even worse, if we don't offer all of our site's functionality to the mobile site, then users on "desktop" computers find themseleves equally unable to perform tasks that were deemed unnecessary on a mobile site.

But more challenges are ahead. Many popular video game consoles available today offer robust web browsers, and SmartTVs are becoming more and more affordable. What happens when you have to maintain a mobile, a desktop, and a widescreen TV website? What about the next device that comes along that changes our assumptions about how people use the web?

There is an easier way to build sites for existing and future devices. We can maintain a single code base, making life easier for both our employees and our users, while still providing an optimal experience for any range of devices. And best of all, we can do it using good old Web standards.

## Responsive Web Design

In early 2010, Ethan Marcotte, a web designer from Boston, coined the name "Responsive Web Design" to refer to a suite of design techniques for building fluid, adaptive websites that respond to the device they are viewed on. By designing sites with fluid grids, using flexible images, and employing new CSS media queries, Marcotte was able to build websites that scaled beautifully on any screen size. 

### Fluid Grids

### Flexible Images

### Media Queries

When CSS3 came out, the existing media attribute for stylesheets was expanded. Whereas in CSS 2.1 you could declare stylesheets for screen, print, and even handheld, with CSS 3 granular attribute detection was added. Now you could serve up CSS to a screen that met certain width criteria, or was held in landscape, or even resolutions and aspect ratios. [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/] Since the techniques of determining devices and browsers were essentially trying to determine what size the screen of the device viewing the website was to serve up the optimal format, CSS width media queries were a perfect way to solve this problem without getting stuck in a race to keep up with browser versions or device models.

Media queries are added as attributes to link elements, CSS @import statements, or inline stylesheets as conditionals like the media attributes before them. For instance, here's a stylesheet that will load only if the device has a screen and the browser width is at least 600 pixels, shown in three equivalent declarations:

	<link rel="styleheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" media="screen and (min-width:600px)" />
	@import TK

Or inside a stylesheet:

	@media screen and (min-width:600px) {
		/* Awesome styles here */
	}

This gives us a lot of flexibility on loading size-specific CSS, since we can target screen widths which will help capture a wide range of devices. But there are a few best practices we should keep in mind when writing media queries.

First, don't use pixel values for your media queries; use ems. Rather than being a fixed width measurement, ems are a relative measure that allows for user zooming without making our sites unusable. Unless you change the default body font-size in your style sheet, you can assume that by default 1em = 16 pixels. So for our previous example, instead of calling the stylesheet at 600pixels, we'll call it at 600 pixels / 16 pixels = 37.5ems. So our query would read:
	
	@media screen and (min-width: 37.5em) {
		/* Awesome styles here */
	}

Now when a user activates their browser's zoom feature, our media queries will activate based on the relative widths of the elements, or when the break points actually fail, rather than on specific widths which could activate media queries based on pixels as the browser effectively reduces pixel density of the display.

Second, write all of your media queries in a single stylesheet instead of loading separate stylesheets for each query. This reduces load times since you are only doing a single server call for your CSS instead of several.

## RWD at GVSU: 

When we started talking about implementing RWD at GVSU, we had a few core goals for the new site. First, it had to work and be usable on any device, from an 8-year-old flip phone with a bare-bones web browser to the latest tablets and laptops our students and faculty were increasingly using. We wanted a single code base based on Web standards, since our Web services staff is just me and one part-time student. We wanted it to be attractive and maybe even fun to use, and we wanted to take advantage of the capabilities of newer devices without leaving older phones and computers from accessing our services.

In addition, we wanted all of our disparate sites that are spread across different vendors to appear to be a cohesive website. With no budget, and just me making changes.

Some of our goals had to be revised, since we immediately encountered some challenges that were out of our control. Like most libraries, we rely on hosted vendor projects for many of our services. As such, having a single code base was not technically possible, since many of our customizations would need to be spread over a variety of proprietary hosted interfaces that offered differing levels of customization. However, we decided to start with the campus CMS pages, since the University's website design would determine the overall look of our template. In addition, we work closely with our University's web team and had the most flexibility on making design changes.

Our first step was to implement RWD techniques on a smaller sub-website within the library to see what challenges would pop up working within the University's framework. In the spring of 2011 I started work redesigning the website for our new library usng responsive principles. [Figure]


RWD at GVSU
Goals for the site: usable on any device, attractive (and maybe fun) on more capable devices
Challenge: library website was not a cohesive site. Code base largely dictated by outside influences: hosted vendor sites (Summon, 360 Link, EZProxy login, Illiad, Ares), campus CMS (custom), library=specific tools (Library Labs, Instruction Menu) - make them all look and work uniformly on all devices. With no budget and just me.
First step: test the waters of the CMS
Build the Mary I promotional site inside the CMS to see what can be done. 
	Challenges: default non-responsive styles from campus. 2 approaches: overwrite AND remove with JS - other people's templates
	Benefits: small, contained, targeted site with single code base.
* Navigation patterns
Thinking big: Campus moves to responsive design
Waiting.
Now only CMS content needs to use our styles: template is already responsive!
Challenges: content, tables, consitency
* Your website has too much crap.
* Designing a flexible grid system
* RWD patterns for tables

Vendor websites
Challenges: unlikely to convince a vendor to move in this direction
* Vendors that give you nearly complete control (Illiad)
* Vendors that give you some access to branding but use tables for layout: do your best and then employ javascript to enhance capable devices  (360Link Reset)
* Vendors that don't give you much control
* Vendors that do device or browser detection that you can't control (Summon, LibGuides)
* The response: library website hasn't been live long enough to get quantitative data, but in my experience there is no a-ha moment: this is what your users expect. No one pats you on the back when you meet basic expectations.
