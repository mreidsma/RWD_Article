When I came to Grand Valley State University in late 2010, they were already trying to find a solution to the increased mobile usage of their website. That year, the GVSU Library website traffic from mobile devices was a measley .5% of all visits, while the University as a whole saw traffic from mobile devices reach 4.5% of all visits. Now just 18 months later, GVSU's library has a tenfold increase in mobile traffic. Visits from mobile devices for the first 6 months of this year hit 4.95%. That's 1 in every 20 visitors to our website using a mobile device. This growth is only continuing.

The problem was that our website was nearly unusable on a mobile device. They knew they had to do something.

## The Myth of the Mobile Web

Most of the discussion about providing access to our services for mobile users centered around the most common practice at the time: detecting a user's device or browser and serving up a different, "stripped-down" version of the lbrary website to mobile devices. But these methods are unsustainable, with countless new smartphone models released every week. In addition, there is performance to consider when using this method, since users will need to load the device library and code to detect devices and then potentially be redirected to a new site which then starts loading from sratch. Since users on mobile devices expect sites to load faster than on more powerful desktop computers[SOURCE], this is a losing proposition. 

In the years before coming to GVSU Libraries I had been wrestling with these same issues in my private client work. Ultimately, I embraced Responsive Web Design techniques as a sustainable, scalable way to handle increasing mobile traffic to the sites I was building. But this involved more than just a change in technique; I had to change the way I thought about the "mobile web."

In short, I realized that it's a myth.  "There is no Mobile Web," Stephen Hay wrote. "There is only The Web, which we view in different ways."[http://www.the-haystack.com/2011/01/07/there-is-no-mobile-web/] 

The myth, I think, comes from an outdated understanding of mobile phones. In the early ninties, a teenager like Zach Morris on Saved By the Bell using a cell phone was a punch line in a sitcom. Mobile phones were for busy professionals who were on the go and didn't have time to wait around for calls. They certainly weren't going to be someone's primary communications tool. Twenty years later, we are on track to have more activated mobile devices than people on the planet[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/0,,contentMDK:23190786~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282823,00.html]. 88% of Americans own a cell phone, and nearly half of those are smartphones.[http://pewinternet.org/Infographics/2012/A-Closer-Look-at-Gadget-Ownership.aspx] A whopping 77% of teens age 12-17 have a cellphone, and 25% of those are smartphones.[http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Teens-and-smartphones/Summary-of-findings.aspx] Mobile phones are no longer a business tool for the distracted professional. They are a lifestyle tool for everyone.

But the myth of the Mobile web stil encourages us to think about mobile web use as occassional use by distracted people who are on the go on a slow network. But the data shows a more complicated picture of how people use the web on mobile devices. According to a 2012 Pew Internet report, 17% of cell phone owners connect to the web primarily or only through their phone, while 45% of 18-29 year-old who browse the web on their phone use the phone as their primary device. [http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012.aspx]  

How we use our phones is different in reality as well. TK% of smartphone owners browse the web on a mobile device while home, TK% while waiting in line or during miscellaneous downtimes[SOURCE], and TK% even admit to using them in the bathroom[SOURCE]. The thing is, phones are increasingly becoming a go-to web browsing device. As libraries who strive to provide access everyone, making our services available on mobile devices is a must.

But how do we offer all of our servces to mobile users without detecting devices or browsers? Responsive Web Design is one solution. RWD is a suite of techniques for building sites that look great on all devices, regardless of screen resolution. But more than that, RWD only makes sense when you look at the Web as a single thing we access from many deives, rather than a separate mobile and desktop web.

## What is RWD?

In early 2010, Ethan Marcotte coined the term "Responsive Web Design" to refer to a suite of design techniques fo building fluid, adaptive websites. All of the techniques had been in the designers' toolkit for some time, but Marcotte put them together in an innovative way. By designing layouts based on a flexible grid, using flexible images, and combining these things together with CSS media queries, Marcotte was able to build sites that embraced the fluidity of the web while allowing for sophisticated and varied layouts for different screen resolutions rather than different devices.

If you've been writing CSS for long, you know that you have many options for specifying the sizes of containers and elements. Although it is only one option, the most common practice is to use pixels to determine width, height, margins, and padding. But pixels themselves have some drawbacks. They rely on
