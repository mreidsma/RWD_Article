When I came to GVSU, they were looking for a way to address growing mobile usage.

Remember, 100% of your users use the website.

Mobile web vs desktop web
prevailing technical technique: browser or device sniffing
Unsustainable, especially for understaffed libraries <data>
In addition, there is a mindset that users on mobile want a different experience, have different intents and are in different contexts

Data on smartphone usage
Not true.
The thing is, there is no mobile web. There is only the web. -Stephen Hay

Embrace the web's fluidity - John Alsopp quote

31% of adults who own cell use phone as primary internet source and 45% of 18-29 year olds use phone as primary source

We wanted a website that was accessible to all users on all devices, not just the one's with a certain type of phone or the latest OS. After all, we don't turn people away or give them limited service if they come into our building wearing out-of-date clothes or the wrong color backpack.

We also wanted to minimize the effort needed to maintain support for all these devices: no updating browser or device sniffing libraries, no duplication of content, no duplication of templates for different devices. In other words, we wanted a web page that embraced the features of the web. A site that was fluid, adaptable, and responsive.

Basics:
1. Flexible grids
2. Flexible images
3. CSS3 media queries

Shortly after I arrived at GVSU and get a feel for our custom CMS, I was asked to redesign a website dedicated to our new building. I thought this would be a good opportunity to introduce the library and campus to RWD, and work out how to make a site responsive within a design framework I didn't control.

How that went.

Our campus web team, who is responsible for the CMS, had been searching for a solution to the growing mobile traffic as well, and settled on RWD after seeing the Mary Idema Pew website. This delayed the rollout of the library's responsive site, since I knew that within a year campus would redesign their entire site and I would have much less CSS to fight against, since the CMS framework itself would be responsive, and I wouldn't have to rewrite my own CSS and javascript in less than a year.

Usability testing for campus' website: desktop, tablet, phone.

RWD helps connect people with what they need seamlessly. Hugh Randle quote on why people come to the library.

People will wait 5 seconds for phone to load page <source>

This is not one of those eminently visible projects that libraries take on and launch with ribbon cutting ceremonies and cheering crowds. This is something that your users, if they own a smart phone or tablet, expect from your website. If you're not serving those users a usable website on their device, or you are redirecting them to a stripped-down version of your services, you are probably irritating them. No one pats you on the back when you do something that is expected.

RWD is the future of the web. Companies large and small are adopting these principles, in some cases over native apps, (Boston Globe) to simultaneously reduce their own web fragmentation and to make things better for users. Other libraries that have gone this route are University of Virginia, Canton Public Library, 

Read Ethan Marcotte's seminal article and book, and find a small project you can use to try out RWD. If you need a boost, try out one of a number of libraries that will get you started quickly, like Twitter's Bootstrap or Foundation. 



When and how you decided to launch it;
·         Its chief aims and objectives;
·         The steps you took to get it off the ground (including specific technologies and equipment used, techniques, staff training, etc.);
·         A description of resources (staff, funds, time) required;
·         An exciting narrative of how your user community reacted and the program’s role in furthering the library mission;
·         Any assessment you’ve done of the service and how that was carried out;
·         Any planned next steps; and,
·         Advice you would offer other libraries seeking to start or expand similar services.
